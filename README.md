Here is a sample description for a GitHub repository containing reusable HTML/React components:

# Reusable Components Library

This repo contains a collection of reusable UI components that can be used across projects.

It includes both plain HTML/CSS components as well as React components for major user interface elements.

## Contents

- Buttons
- Form elements
- Navigation
- Modals/dialogs
- Cards
- Layout blocks
- Interactive elements
- General utilities

The components are built to be customizable and extensible. They encapsulate common UI patterns and behaviors for faster development.

They can be used out of the box or modified/extended as needed for your application.

## Usage

The plain HTML/CSS components can simply be copied over and styled as needed. 

The React components can be installed via npm and imported/used in your React project. They are published as an open source library.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow the guidelines and open issues/pull requests if you would like to add new components or fix bugs.

The goal is to build a comprehensive library of reusable components helping web developers skip repetitive work and build consistent UIs faster.
